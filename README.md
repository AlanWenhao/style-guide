## Style Guide

This Style–guide helps Juwai team members from all departments and locations to collaborate with each other.

### Languages

We are following these conventions for programmatic languages in our technical stack.

- [CSS](language-css.md)
- [HTML](language-html.md)
- [JavaScript](language-javascript.md)
- [PHP](language-php.md)
- [Python](language-python.md)

### Workflow

We are following these processes for our daily work.

- [Writing a commit message](workflow-commit-message.md)
- [Writing Documentation](workflow-document.md)
- [Creating a Defect](workflow-defects.md)
- [Creating a User Story](workflow-user-story.md)
- [Issues priority](workflow-issue-priority.md)

### Tools

Before starting anything, you might want to setup a few tools that will help you get started on the right foot. They ensure you’re notified if some code does not match these style–guides. You might want to install the respective plugin for your editor; configuration files in the repository should do the rest.

- [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) <q>helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs</q>.
- [phplint](http://www.icosaedro.it/phplint/) for PHP.
- [htmllint](http://htmlhint.com/) for HTML.
- [csslint](http://csslint.net/) for CSS.
- [jshint](http://jshint.com/) for JavaScript.
