## JavaScript

Please refer to [Idiomatic JavaScript](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-js)
for style–guides about JavaScript.


### Addendum

We want to **target bugs as soon as possible**. To do so, we should always add
`'use strict';` as the first statement of any function at the root of the
document.


### Tools

Please use the [.jscsrc](.jscsrc) and [.jshintrc](.jshintrc) files in this
repository for your projects. These files contain most of the style–guide
related issues addressed by our style–guides.

You can use them in you environment with the relevant softwares or plugins:

* JSHint: http://jshint.com/install/
* JSCS: http://jscs.info/overview#friendly-packages
