## Issue priorities

The priority of issues indicates when the issue should be handled and when it should be resolved.
There are examples of issue *severity* to give an idea of how a *priority* can be assigned.

Although *severity* and *priority* are often related, please keep in mind they are [different topics](http://wiki.openbravo.com/wiki/QA_Processes/Defects_Severity_Priority).

### Normal
